# John Meas test App with Reactjs

* I was able to get all the messages to display in a messagelist component.

* I used react-router-dom in an attempt to display single messages in a different component. Unfortunately, I had difficulty pulling individual messages. I'm sure with more time I could get that working.

* The post messages form works and posts to the server but I had some difficulty with the delete functionality due to an issue with  `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`.


This took about 4 hours, with abit of extra time to write this half decent readme file.
Cheers!
